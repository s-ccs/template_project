## Overview of Folder Structure 

```
│projectdir          <- Project's main folder. It is initialized as a Git
│                       repository with a .gitignore file.
│
├── experiment       <- Files for running the experiment
|
├── notebooks        <- Pluto, Jupyter, Weave or any other mixed media notebooks.*
|
├── papers           <- Materials related to paper, publishing
|
├── _research        <- WIP scripts, code, notes, comments,
│   |                   to-dos and anything in an alpha state.
│
├── plots            <- All exported plots go here, best in date folders.
|   |                   Note that to ensure reproducibility it is required that all plots can be
|   |                   recreated using the plotting scripts in the scripts folder.
|
│
├── scripts          <- Various scripts, e.g. simulations, plotting, analysis,
│   │                   The scripts use the `src` folder for their base code.
│
├── src              <- Source code for use in this project. Contains functions,
│                       structures and modules that are used throughout
│                       the project and in multiple scripts.
│
├── test             <- Folder containing tests for `src`.
│   └── runtests.jl  <- Main test file
│
├── README.md        <- Top-level README.
|
├── .gitignore       <- produced by Dr. Watson
│
├── (Manifest.toml)  <- Contains full list of exact package versions used currently.
|── (Project.toml)   <- Main project file, allows activation and installation. Produced by Dr. Watson
|── (project_project_template.toml)   <-  This is for a content-wise description of your experiment. 
                                          Change "project_template" in the filename to your project name. 
                        
```

\*Instead of having a separate *notebooks* folder, you can also delete it and integrate your notebooks in the scripts folder. However, notebooks should always be marked by adding `nb_` in front of the file name.


# template_project - produced by Dr. Watson

This code base is using the [Julia Language](https://julialang.org/) and
[DrWatson](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/stable/)
to make a reproducible scientific project named
> template_project

To (locally) reproduce this project, do the following:

0. Download this code base. Notice that raw data are typically not included in the
   git-history and may need to be downloaded independently.
1. Open a Julia console and do:
   ```
   julia> using Pkg
   julia> Pkg.add("DrWatson") # install globally, for using `quickactivate`
   julia> Pkg.activate("path/to/this/project")
   julia> Pkg.instantiate()
   ```

This will install all necessary packages for you to be able to run the scripts and
everything should work out of the box, including correctly finding local paths.

You may notice that most scripts start with the commands:
```julia
using DrWatson
@quickactivate "template_project"
```
which auto-activate the project and enable local path handling from DrWatson.
